Relevant files for Luka, Robbie, Amir and Yaquub's 2022 DATA201 Group Project - Modelling suicide rates based on multiple socoioeconomic factors.

This is a public project, 

To get started, you can familiarise yourself with our data using this shiny app:
https://4q2fgc-luka0foy.shinyapps.io/interactivesuicideplots/?_ga=2.235376518.66622219.1666048774-1683258422.1666048774

Or, if you want to jump straight into it, you can download our R package containing all our wrangled datasets via:
library(devtools)
install_github('popsnot/suicidedata')
library(suicidedata)
